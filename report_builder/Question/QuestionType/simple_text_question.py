        SimpleTextQuestionViewAdmin class represents the implementation of the template administrator view for a question object
        This view is built to be extended from the different question types of the Derb system
        By itself, this view provides the functionality for ordering and deletion of question, and a form with question
        text and help
        
        This class be extended using an implementation like this:

        .. code:: python

            from report_builder.Question.QuestionView import QuestionViewAdmin
            class MyQuestion(QuestionViewAdmin):
                template_name = 'path/to/the/template'
                name = 'my_question'

        The extended methods can be overridden to adjust the functionality of the extended class. For instance:

        .. code:: python

            def additional_template_parameters(self, **kwargs):
                some_dict = {
                    'something': some_variable

                return some_dict

        .. note::
            *kwargs* is a dict that contains the Question attributes 'form', 'report', 'question' and 'name'
            You don't have to append the kwargs content in the return value, only the additional elements
